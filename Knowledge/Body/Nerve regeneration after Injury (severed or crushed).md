Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) present a barrier to axon regeneration. However, no specific receptor for the inhibitory effect of CSPGs has been identified. We showed that a transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPσ, binds with high affinity to neural CSPGs. Binding involves the chondroitin sulfate chains.  
  
After spinal cord injury, PTPσ gene disruption enhanced the ability of axons to penetrate regions containing CSPG.  
  
but it may also result in damaging roles in the other systems, such as inducing DC hyperactivation and autoimmune responses
