*Melatonin dependent. Less melatonin/morning = higher insulin sensitivity.  
*increase ketonbodys  
*decrease cancer  
*anti inflamation  
*increase insulin sensitivity  
*increased ghrelin -> increase Dopamin  
*decrease reactive oxygen species ROS  
*increase superoxide dismutase SOD  
*increase NO  
*increase chaperone proteins (help folding of new syntheticised proteins)  
*increased cortisol  
*increased DNA repair  
*increase Sirtuin-1  
  
-*Sirtuin-1*:  
*activated by hunger  
*Deacetylation mostly of lysin  
*increase FOXO3  
*increase life span up to 30%  
*activated by Resveratrol (supplement)  
  
--*FOXO3*:  
*gene expression of FOXO3 a increased by ketone body Î²-hydroxybutyrate  
*decrease cellcycle (metabolism) called Quiszenz  
*increase antioxidativen enzymes (MnSOD, FeSOD)  
*can activate apoptosis
