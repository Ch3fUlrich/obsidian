*inhibition EP300:  
- EP300: functions as histone acetyltransferase  
- regulates transcription of genes via chromatin remodeling by allowing histone proteins to wrap DNA less tightly.  
- essential role in regulating cell growth and division, prompting cells to mature and assume specialized functions (differentiate)
