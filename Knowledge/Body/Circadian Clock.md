Influences dorsal hippocampus
Long-term memory:
1. acquisition (init). 
2. Consolidation (cellular and synaptic modifications) 
3. Retrieval

#paper #circadianclock #memory 
- mice
- consolidation difference day VS night
- gene period 1
- help form and keep memories

# Method
- object memory location task 
	- two objects, move one, if behaviour difference between objects then learning
	- dorsal hypocampus 
	- LTP consolidation change
