"Fat has an energy content of 9.4 kcal/g and protein, 5.7 kcab/g. Assuming that fat tissue has 1 5 % as water, the stored energy of tissue fat is 8 kcal/g. Similarly, since lean tissue has an average protein content of 20%, it has a storage energy value of 1 .2 kcab/g. A hypothetical line can be constructed using the axes, cost of growth and increase in muscle mass expressed as a percentage of the increase in body weight. Thus if all the tissue laid down is fat tissue, the cost of growth would be 8 kcal/g and 0% of the increase in body weight would be due to new muscle tissue. Similarly, if all of the new tissue is muscle, the cost of growth would be 1 .2 kcal/g and 100% of the weight gain would be muscle tissue. Figure 2 shows this hypothetical line. It also shows that the experimentally obtained points relating cost of growth to tissue composition fall closely on the hypothetical line".

so - 1 # muscle = 909 x 1.2 = ~ 1090 cals (which is close enough to the 1200 Lyle puts forward).  
  
muscles = m, fat = f, burned mcal = b, weight loss = w  
b = 7*f + 1,2 *m  
w = f + m  
-->  
muscles = m, fat = f, mcal defizit = b, weight loss = w  
(b - 1.2*w) / 5.8 = f  
w - f = m
