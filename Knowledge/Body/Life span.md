*increased by better immune system (killing senescent cells)  
*intermittent fasting  
*tryptophan and methionine reduction  
*high fat, moderate protein, low carbs  
*high temperature  
*low temperature  
-activation of UCP2, and SIRT3 which results in more brown fat tissue  
*sport  
-need at least 5 times/week for 20min.  
*calorie restriction  
  
Sirtuins (activated by Resveratrol) :  
• SIRT1, SIRT6, SIRT7 control epigenetic and DNA repair  
• SIRT3, SIRT4, SIRT5 control metabolism  
• SIRT2 cell proliferation and division, production of ova  
• SIRT3 activated when temperatures to high/low  
• SIRT1 and SIRT6 activated after sport.  
• SIRT1 activated when food is restricted  
  
*increased by inhibiting the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway of telomerics  
  
*medics (senolytic - killing scenecet) :  
-likelihood of senolysis damage to cells with structural functions  
-Resveratrol (activation of Sirtuin-1) Inhibiting NF-κB --> can result in apoptosis), which is created by plants to defend against pathogens or UV, also anti inflammatory in nerves  
+NF-κB  
-Metformin (activation of AMPK -> inhibition of MTOR)  
-senolytic agents (target scenscent cells)  
+mediate their effects are lowering of p16Ink4a, targeting Bcl-2 family, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a), and other SCAPs network components  
+Dasatinib (second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor)  
+quercetin a polyphenolic flavonoid (antioxidant)  
+fisetin a flavonol (anti-inflammatory, chemopreventive, and chemotherapeutic)  
  
+dasatinib + quercetin better in combination (senolytic to cells, that one compound does not affect)  
  
*medics (Senomorphic - deactivating negative effects of senescent cells)  
-neutralizing antibodies targeting SASP components (like mTOR inhibitors)  
+mTOR provides SASP production  
-attenuate SASP modulating effects on NF-κB  
+apigenin  
+kaempfero  
  
Senotherapie:  
Senolytic drugs were reported to improve cardiac function in mice, enhance insulin sensitivity, reduce the adipose tissue inflammation, and alleviate many age-related diseases in which the accumulation of senescent cells plays role in its pathogenesis including Alzheimer’s disease, chronic lung diseases, osteoporosis, and intervertebral disk disease
