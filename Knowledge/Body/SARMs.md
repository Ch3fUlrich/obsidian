Wichtige Blutwerte für sarms:  
• Testo gesamt, LH (um zu sehen wie stark es die Produktion gesenkt hat)  
• Estradiol (falls freies testo zu niedrig, damit man mit Tamox/Enclo wieder erhöht)  
• HDL/LDL - 5€ (leidet ebenfalls unter sarms)  
• AST, ALT - 17,95 €(Leberwerte leiden auch immer unter sarms, falls zu schlecht kann man TUDCA nehmen)  
  
Pros are:  
• Stimulates muscle growth, regeneration process  
• Works as an aggressive fat burner  
• orally active  
• Nonsteroidal drug  
• safe for stacking  
  
Cons are:  
• It may need a Post-cycle therapy to balance hormones  
  
Substances:  
• NEP28 (neutral endopeptidase): upregulation of neprilysin which suppresses the plaques. It inactivates several peptide hormones including glucagon, enkephalins, substance P, neurotensin, oxytocin, and bradykinin  
• LGD-4033, Ligandrol, VK5211: 10-20mg oral, largest anabolic activity in relation to its androgenic activity, affected both lipid levels and testosterone levels, by suppressing HDL, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).  
• BMS-564,929: counteract decrease in muscle mass over time, and at higher doses even increased muscle mass, without significantly affecting prostate tissue. vastly reduce luteinizing hormone levels, it being an astonishing 33× more suppressive compound than testosterone  
• AC-262536: 66% of the anabolic action of testosterone, but only around 27% of its potency as an androgen  
• LGD-2226: anabolic effects in both muscle and bone tissue, but with considerably less effects on prostate weight and lutenizing hormone levels than testosterone  
•LGD-3303: partial agonist for androgenic effects, but a full agonist for anabolic effects, enhance the effectiveness of a bisphosphonate drug (disrupt intracellular enzymatic functions needed for bone resorption)  
• RAD140, testolone: 20mg for 10 weeks, most potent? 4-6kg muscle in 6-8weeks, strength increase at week 3 or 4, production of red blood cells, fat loss, faster regeneration, pump, one known case of liver damage.  
• YK11: 5-15mg, 6-8weeks, HF= 12h, Myostatin inhibitor, Hair-loss, Mild acne, aggressiveness, lower libido, gynicomastie at 40mg/day, liver damage above 30mg/day, do not stack with other SARMs  
  
  
Increase fat loss:  
• caderine, GW 50156: 5-25mg, hf=16h, PPAR-δ agonist (PPAR-β/δ and AMPK agonists are regarded as exercise mimetics), changes the body's fuel preference from glucose to lipids, role of this protein in myelination of the corpus callosum, epidermal cell proliferation, and glucose and lipid metabolism, HDL-Cholesterin erhöht, LDL verringert  
•MK-2866, Ostarine, Enobosarm, GTx-024: hf= 24h, 20mg + Cardarine 10mg, 8-40 weeks, strong fat burn by switch to fat metabolism, decrease cholesterol, increased Alanine Transaminase of liver (liver damage?)  
• SR9009: 20-30mg/day, hf=5h, Stenabolic, Rev-ErbA agonist, increase mitochondrial count, metabolism, immune system, endurance, decrease inflamation , strengthen day cycle  
• MK 677, Ibutamoren or Nutrobal: 10-25mg/day, 16-20 weeks, hf=24-30h not a SARM! it's a selective ghrelin receptor agonist, promote GH, well researched, increase sleep quality, increase skin hair nail quality, improved concentration, enhanced perception, improved energy levels, enhanced mood

Luteinizing hormone (LH) :  
• akute rise of LH triggers ovulation  
• stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone in male  
• HCG is used as a substitute of LH, because of longer half life and same receptor agonism  
  
HGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
optimal:  
IGF-1 LR3 10-20ug (after training)  
2IU HGH (2h before breakfast)  
2IU HGH (2h after dinner)  
  
*Growth Hormone(GH)*:  
*duration: 4-5h till peak, elevated up to 8-12h (probably best in 2IU morning 2h before eat and 2IU evening 2h after eat)  
*4IU = 1.33mg. 2IU increases HGH in body time 3  
*max 71ug/L 1h after sleep = 390ug in body  
*adults secrete 400ug/day distributed over 3-5h release intervals  
*increases lipolysis and glycolysis  
*inhibited by free fatty acids  
*increased by exercise, nutrition, sleep  
*improves regeneration, lean muscle mass growth, bone density by increasing IGF-1 production in the liver  
*decrease fat  
*support cognitive functions

*decrease insulin sensitivity  
*excessive water retention  
  
*Ipamorelin*:  
half-life: 2h  
dose: 1-3x 200-300ug

-*Ghrelin*:  
*increased while fasting, sleep deprivation  
*increases GH, learning, dopamine, taste, smell, hunger  
*Anit-depressant  
*secrete Neuropeptide Y  
*visceral and somatic hypersensitivity could be attenuated by a peripherally restricted ghrelin mimetic  
  
--*Neuropeptide Y* (NPY):  
*increased by glucocorticosteroids  
*increase food intake and storage, vasoconstrictor  
*decrease blood pressure, addiction, anxiety, stress, pain  
*linked to obesity, when NPY secretion is resistant to leptin  
*receptors Y1, Y5 stimulate feeding, Y2, Y4 inhibit feeding  
*release luteinizing hormone  
*plays a role in neurogenesis in the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) mostly for olfactory neurogenesis and dental gyrus for new episodic memories (trough ERK kinase signaling pathway)  
  
---*luteinizing hormone*:  
*increase testosterone in male  
*triggers ovulation in female  
  
-*GHRHHR*:  
-*increase GH production, mostly over the cAMP pathway, but also Phospholipase-C pathway  
  
*GHRP-6*:  
dosage: 100ug 3x/day, 3h between injections and 1h befor oder 2h after food  
hf: 15-60min  
• increas gh  
• increase ACTH, which releases cortisol (increased stress signal)  
• increased hgh releas with GHRH or CJC  
  
*IGF-1 LR3*:  
dosage: 20-100ug  
half-life: 20-30h  
*low affinity to bind to IGFBPs -> more stable  
*3x more potent then IGF-1  
  
-*IGF-1*:  
*normal bioactive level in humans of about 1mg or 200ug/L  
*inhibited trough insulin  
*improves regeneration (even nervous system), collagen production, muscle growth, bone density, cognitive functions,  
*reduce heart, cardio-vascular diseases, catabolic, blood sugar,  
*IGF-1 bound to IGFBP-3 = anabol  
*IGF-1 bound to IGFBP-1 = not anabol
