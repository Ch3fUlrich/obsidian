  
Therapie:  
• Tyrosinkinase (oft Signal für Wachstum) inhibitors to decrease cell division. Kinase fügt Phosphat zu tyrosin hinzu, welches oft zur aktivierend wirkt. Tyrosinkinaserezeptorsysteme (Insulin-Rezeptor, EGF-Rezeptor, NGF-Rezeptor, PDF-Rezeptor).  
  
cell proliferation and cell survival:  
• NF-κB (schizophrenie, cancer)  
• p38 MAPK abnormal activity, when oxidative stress is present. Can cause excessive high activity of NF-κB activity --> bad  
  
Substances:  
• Resveratrol (Inhibiting NF-κB --> can result in apoptosis), which is created by plants to defend against pathogens or UV, also anti inflammatory in nerves  
- NF-κB involved in cellular responses to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, heavy metals, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidized LDL, and bacterial or viral antigens. Implicated in processes of synaptic plasticity and memory  
• melatonin involving a melatonin receptor-mediated suppression of cAMP levels, resulting in diminished tumor plasma fatty acid(FA) transport, possibly via decreased FA transport protein (FATP) function. The inhibition of these signal transduction events by melatonin culminates in the suppression of linoleic acid (LA) uptake, LA metabolism to the mitogenic signaling molecule 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) , and cancer growth.
