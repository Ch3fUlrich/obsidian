HIF1A:  
- activated by Deferiprone (enhances cell metabolism, proliferation, and survival of fibroblasts while reducing lactate dehydrogenase levels)  
- Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha  
- influence vascularization and angiogenesis, energy metabolism(glucose and iron) , cell survival, and tumor invasion  
- induce transcription of more than 60 genes, including VEGF/VEGFA and erythropoietin(stimulates red blood cell production)  
- promoting and increasing oxygen delivery to hypoxic regions  
- increase results in regenerates lost or damaged tissue  
- decrease results in healing with a scarring response

Copper peptide GHK-Cu:  
[https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/7/1987/htm](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/7/1987/htm)  
Up-to-date, it is established that GHK-Cu is able to:  
  
- Tighten loose skin and reverse thinning of aged skin  
- Repair protective skin barrier proteins  
- Improve skin firmness, elasticity, and clarity  
- Reduce fine lines, depth of wrinkles, and improve structure of aged skin  
- Smooth rough skin  
- Reduce photodamage, mottled hyperpigmentation, skin spots and lesions  
- Improve overall skin appearance  
- Stimulate wound healing  
- Protect skin cells from UV radiation  
- Reduce inflammation and free radical damage  
- Increase hair growth and thickness, enlarge hair follicle size  
  
*released after tissues injury  
*Probably working through up and down-regulating genes  
*copper complex of the tripeptide glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine  
*strong affinity for copper(II)  
*decrease fibrinogen (blood clothing)  
*promote wound healing, attraction of immune cells, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and promotion of blood vessels growth  
*modulates expression of genes -> generally to healthier state  
*chelating metal ions (bonds)  
*stimulated collagen synthesis in skin fibroblasts, increased accumulation of total proteins, glycosaminoglycans (in a biphasic curve) and DNA in the dermal wounds in rats.  
*stimulates metalloproteinases, the enzymes which break down dermal proteins, and their inhibitors (anti-proteases)  
*increased decorin  
-regulation of collagen synthesis, wound healing regulation and anti-tumor defense  
*human: 120 diabetic patients, increasing the percentage of ulcer closure from 60.8% to 98.5%, and decreasing the percentage of infection from 34% to 7%  
*animal: up to 64% faster wound closure  
* facilitated wound healing, causing better wound contraction, faster development of granular tissue and improved angiogenesis. It also elevated the level of antioxidant enzymes. significantly lower levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and elastin-degrading matrix metalloproteinases. faster wound contraction and epithelization, higher level of glutathione and ascorbic acid, increased synthesis of collagen, and activation of fibroblasts and mast cells.[19] Ischemic open wounds in rats treated with GHK-copper healed faster and had decreased concentration of metalloproteinases 2 and 9 as well as of tumor necrosis factor-beta (a major inflammatory cytokine).
