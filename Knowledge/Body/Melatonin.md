Supplementation:  
*0,5mg 30min before sleep. Higher dose make more sleepy, but other effects do not occur in a significant bigger amount  
*half-life: 20-50min  
*caution with children  
-anti-oxidant/inflammatory/apoptosis/ageing  
-increase locomotor activity and body core temperature, by activating brown adipose tissue  
- increases volume of brown adipose tissue by promoting conversion from white to brown fat cells  
-increase GLUT-4 transporter in rats, which is used for glucose uptake  
-increase steroidogenesis, may also progesteron  
-decreases 3-H Dopamin release 50% at 20 pm and 80% at 1nm  
-agonists also decrease 3H Dopamin  
-antagonist Luzindole do not decrease Dopamin  
-promote stem cells to proliferation, migration and differentiation  
-regulates synthesis, secretion, and action of insulin  
-powerful chronobiotic responsible, in part, by the daily distribution of metabolic processes so that the activity/feeding phase of the day is associated with high insulin sensitivity, and the rest/fasting is synchronized to the insulin-resistant metabolic phase of the day  
-increase insulin sensitivity in adipocytes and leptin synthesis  
-decreases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells (by inhibiting the adenylate cyclase/cAMP system and reducing the content of PKA with no alteration in the content of PKCÎ±-subunit, in parallel to a reduction in cGMP)

The energy balance and energy metabolism are under control of the circadian system and exhibits a clear differential 24-hr distribution 105-108 (Fig. 1). The active/wakefulness phase of the day is, typically, associated with energy harvesting and eating that results in energy intake, utilization, and storage. It is a period associated with high central and peripheral sensitivity to insulin and high glucose tolerance, elevated insulin secretion, high glucose uptake by the insulin-sensitive tissues, glycogen synthesis and glycolysis (hepatic and muscular), blockade of hepatic gluconeogenesis, and increased adipose tissue lipogenesis and adiponectin production. By comparison, the rest/sleep phase of the day is characterized by the usual fasting period that requires the use of stored energy for the maintenance of cellular processes. This phase of the daily cycle exhibits insulin resistance, accentuated hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, adipose tissue lipolysis, and leptin secretion.

even with an intact pineal production of melatonin, melatonin supplementation therapy in young animals reduces long-term body weight gain (roughly by 25%) and the size of the visceral fat deposits (by 50%) 131. These effects were not dependent on a reduction in food intake. The same anti-obesity protective effect of melatonin was seen in experiments of diet-induced obesity
