sleepiness increased by Melatonin  
-anti-oxidant/inflammatory/apoptosis/ageing  
-decreases 3-H Dopamin release 50% at 20 pm and 80% at 1nm  
-agonists also decrease 3H Dopamin  
-antagonist do not decrease Dopamin  
-Antagonist: Luzindole  
-promote stem cells to proliferation, migration and differentiation  
-regulates synthesis, secretion, and action of insulin  
-powerful chronobiotic responsible, in part, by the daily distribution of metabolic processes so that the activity/feeding phase of the day is associated with high insulin sensitivity, and the rest/fasting is synchronized to the insulin-resistant metabolic phase of the day  
-increase insulin sensitivity in adipocytes and leptin synthesis  
-decreases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells (by inhibiting the adenylate cyclase/cAMP system and reducing the content of PKA with no alteration in the content of PKCÎ±-subunit, in parallel to a reduction in cGMP)  
  
  
*wakup response: Cortisol increase (stress)  
-katabol  
-increase fat and glucose levels in blood  
-less strong increase when evening type, fatigue, pain, is present
