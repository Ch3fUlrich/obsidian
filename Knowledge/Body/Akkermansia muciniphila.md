## Facts
- strict anaerobic
- mucin-degrading bacterium 
- 3-5% of bacteria in Colon (mittlerer Darm)
- found in mother milk 
- [[HFD]] reduces abundance 
- [[B. animalis subsp. lactis LMG P-28149]] promotes growth
	- because of [[SCFA]] production 
		- because [[SCFA]] promote mucin growth
## Supplementation 
### Prebiotics
* Obst und 
* Gemüse 
	* Rhabarber
* [[FOS]]
* indirect:
	* [[GOS]] because of lactis bakteria 
	* [[XOS]]? 
* medications
	* metformin
* antibiotics (indirect)

### Probiotic use
- 4-8 weeks of 4.0 × 108 cfu/d A. muciniphila [restored bakteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6223323/)

### Effects
* restore mucus thickness 
* reduction of serum [[LPS]]
* reduce probability for Diabetes
	* by reducing glucose tolerance 
* weight loss
* lover diseases
- increases intestinal barrier (less [[leaky gut Syndrom]]) 
	- by increasing activity of epithelial cells
		- increased intestinal mucosa
			- less Lipopolysaccharide in blood plasma
				- less inflamation
