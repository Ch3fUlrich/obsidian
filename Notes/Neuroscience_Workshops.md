## Neuroscience Workshop 11
### Session 1 - Learning and plasticity
#### Serotonin Asymmetrically Gates Cortical Feedforward and Feedback Circuits
*Leafy Behera (DBM, Andreas Keller Lab)*

1. Acute acitvation of Serotonin drives the Feedback Circuits
2. Serotonin ehances signaling in feedback but not in feedforward circuits

#### Toward Recurrent Circuit Models for Learning Latent Structure from Sensory Streams
*Ashena Gorgan Mohammadi (FMI, Friedemann Zenke Lab)*

1. RPL
   1. Fast Neural Encoder to convert sensory input into a latent representation
   2. Recurrent Neural Network to learn the latent representation
2. Hierarchical RPL
   1. Multiple layers of RPL stacked on top of each other
   2. Each layer learns a different level of abstraction of the input data
3. RPL can learn to predict future inputs and generate new inputs

#### Cholinergic modulation of threat-induced activity ramps in auditory thalamus
*James Taylor (DBM, Tania Rinaldi Barkat Lab)*

               

### Session 2 â€“ Cell types diversity and their functions
#### A postnatal molecular switch drives the activity-dependent maturation of parvalbumin interneurons
*Monika Moissidis (IOB, Botond Roska Lab)*



### Brainstem Building Blocks to Generate Complex Forelimb Movement
*Haohao Wu (FMI/BZ, Silvia Arber Lab)*

1. Brainstem circuits are involved in the generation of complex forelimb movements.
2. Different brainstem nuclei are involved in different aspects of forelimb movement.

### Gated dendritic EI balance enables context-dependent associative memory
*Severin Berger (BZ, Everton Agnes Lab)*

## Neuroscience Workshop 10 

### Session 1 - Sensation an Action
#### Studying neural computation using spiking neural network models
*Julia Gygax (FMI, Friedemann Zenke Lab)*

1. Use Statistical Spiking Neural Networks (SSNNs) to model neural computation.
2. Silent neurons that occure when weights are too small will be upregulated using a homeostatic plasticity $\rightarrow$ rescue.
3. Surrogate gradients are used to train SSNNs with gradient descent.


#### Midbrain inhibition regulates motor thalamic reticular nucleus activity during skilled forelimb behavior 
*Madhav Sridharan (FMI/BZ, Silvia Arber Lab)*

1. Midbrain impacts TRN neuron activity during skilled forelimb behavior.

#### Visuomotor mismatch responses in freely moving humans
*Magdalena Solyga (FMI, Georg Keller Lab)*

1. People walking around with a VR headset an get a Visuomotor mismatch $\rightarrow$ mismatch responses visible in brain.

### Session 2 - Altered sensory experience
#### Characterizing the neuronal circuit underlying electroconvulsive therapy
*Hugo Ladret (FMI, Georg Keller Lab)*

1. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is used to treat severe depression and schizophrenia.
2. ECT induces a seizure that is thought to reset the brain and relieve symptoms. A therapy is composed of 3 sessions / week for multiple months and afterwards the patient is free of symptoms for a long time. Maintainance ECT is used to prevent relapse after every 6 months.
3. ECT creates an influx of potasium and calcium ion influx in the full brain comming from outsied to inside of the brain. cFOS expression 1h after ECT is strongly increased in cortex and hippocampuse, amygdala, thalamus and hypothalamus.
4. This behavior of activity spreading through the brain after homeostatic pertubation (electical) happens is called Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD) and always happens when such a perturbation is applied. This was initially described when the cortex of rabbits was pinched and the activity spread through the brain. This is currently hypothesized to be a type of reset of the brain.
5. CSD can not be triggered if the NMDA receptor is blocked using ketamine, which is also used as an antidepressant.
6. Correlation between cortical areas is not strongy changed, besides in layer 5 neurons similar to antipsychotic drugs.
7. ECT can cause memory loss.

#### Neuronal coding of restored hearing: cortical vs cochlear stimulation
*James Taylor (DBM, Tania Barkat Lab)*

1. Using cochlear implants to restore hearing in deaf patients is not working properly when loud noise is present.
2. Implants in the auditory cortex in mice can restore hearing in the presence of loud noise even though the cochlear is not working as intended.

#### Joint visual-vestibular computation of head direction and reflexive eye movement
*Tamas Dalamy (IOB, Botond Roska Lab)*

1.
