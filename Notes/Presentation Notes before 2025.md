    • different skills mature at different ages
    • frequency sensitivity decreases in adulthood, may because of attention
    • hearing is not possible in the first days. Ears open up later. Spontaneous activity in the auditory system, tonotopically organiced, in both sides simultaneously, originates in cochlear by ATP release
    • deafness lead to reorganization of the brain --> used for visual cortex (only if deaf size young age)
    • most of the learning happens bevor 5 years of life
    • gaba decreases critical plasticity time window
    • myelin decreases plasticity, because it stabilizes axons --> reinstate plasticity in adult brain possible
