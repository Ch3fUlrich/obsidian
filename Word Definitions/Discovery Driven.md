Discovery-driven analysis is a method of planning and managing new ventures or initiatives that are uncertain or risky. It is based on the idea that the assumptions behind a plan need to be tested and validated before investing too much time and money into it. [It also allows for flexibility and adaptation when new information or feedback is obtained](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning) [1](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning)[2](https://bing.com/search?q=discovery-driven+analysis).

The main steps of discovery-driven analysis are:

- Define the success criteria and the desired outcomes of the plan, such as the revenue, profit margin, market share, customer satisfaction, etc. [You can use a reverse income statement to calculate the required numbers based on the expected results](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning) [1](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning).
- Benchmark the success criteria against the market and competitive realities, such as the size, growth, trends, customer preferences, and competitors’ offerings. You can use external data sources, industry reports, surveys, interviews, etc. [to gather relevant information](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning) [1](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning).
- Specify the operational requirements and the activities needed to execute the plan, such as the product features, distribution channels, marketing strategies, organizational structure, etc. You can use a flow chart, a Gantt chart, a value chain analysis, etc. [to map out the process](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning) [1](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning).
- Document the assumptions and hypotheses that underlie the plan, such as the customer needs, the value proposition, the pricing, the cost structure, the market response, etc. You can use a table, a list, a canvas, etc. [to organize the assumptions](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning) [1](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning).
- Test the assumptions and hypotheses using experiments, prototypes, pilots, trials, etc. You can use quantitative and qualitative methods, such as surveys, interviews, observations, analytics, etc. [to collect and analyze data](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning) [1](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning).
- Review the results and feedback at key checkpoints and decide whether to continue, revise, or terminate the plan. You can use a dashboard, a scorecard, a report, etc. [to summarize and communicate the findings](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning) [1](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning).

Discovery-driven analysis is an ongoing and iterative process that requires a willingness to learn from mistakes and adjust accordingly. [It helps to reduce the risk of failure and increase the chances of success in uncertain and dynamic environments](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning) [1](https://hbr.org/2017/02/a-refresher-on-discovery-driven-planning)[2](https://bing.com/search?q=discovery-driven+analysis).
