In [applied mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics "Applied mathematics"), **topological data analysis** (**TDA**) is an approach to the analysis of datasets using techniques from [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology "Topology"). Extraction of information from datasets that are high-dimensional, incomplete and noisy is generally challenging. TDA provides a general framework to analyze such data in a manner that is insensitive to the particular [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics) "Metric (mathematics)") chosen and provides [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction "Dimensionality reduction") and robustness to noise. Beyond this, it inherits [functoriality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor "Functor"), a fundamental concept of modern mathematics, from its topological nature, which allows it to adapt to new mathematical tools.

The initial motivation is to study the shape of data. TDA has combined [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology "Algebraic topology") and other tools from pure mathematics to allow mathematically rigorous study of "shape". The main tool is [persistent homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology "Persistent homology"), an adaptation of [homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_(mathematics) "Homology (mathematics)") to [point cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud "Point cloud") data. Persistent homology has been applied to many types of data across many fields. Moreover, its mathematical foundation is also of theoretical importance. The unique features of TDA make it a promising bridge between topology and geometry.
